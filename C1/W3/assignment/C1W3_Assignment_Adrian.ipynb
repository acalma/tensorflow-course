    "In the videos you looked at how you would improve Fashion MNIST using Convolutions. For this exercise see if you can improve MNIST to 99.5% accuracy or more by adding only a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D layer to the model from the  assignment of the previous week. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should stop training once the accuracy goes above this amount. It should happen in less than 10 epochs, so it's ok to hard code the number of epochs for training, but your training must end once it hits the above metric. If it doesn't, then you'll need to redesign your callback.\n",

This data might be in black and white format so the third dimension doesn't really add any additional information for the classification process but it is a good practice regardless.\n",
